## Project Overview
Before I began this project, I simply wanted to learn to develop a demo using the original PS1 SDK and the C language. Shortly after starting it, however, I thought this would be more fun if I embraced it as a broader learning experience.

This is why, as you might have seen from the table of contents, this readme serves as an interesting, albeit cursory, breakdown of the first commercial PS1's hardware, MIPS Assembly, the PsyQ SDK, and emulation.

## PlayStation 1 Hardware Overview
The PlayStation 1 model SCPH-1000 was released in Japan on December 3, 1994. This was the first commercial unit, featuring an S-video port, parallel I/O ports, and RCA connectors, all of which would be removed in subsequent revisions.
